# hello-world
This repository will be used to practice the use of the Git/GitHub tools in my quest to learning to program in R.
I decided to make these changes to give more info about my purpose.
I am a full time FX trader and need to have proficiency in a programming language that will allow me to backtest several strategies on several instruments in several timeframes. R will be used for that purpose in a lot of historical data.
